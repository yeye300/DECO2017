It's an app to help college students study. His name is HELP. In the APP, you can clearly see the dictionary, countdown, timer, music player and schedule. They are included in the Home Page. On the home page, users can clearly see all functions (except music), and the music page is only used in StopWatch and Pomodoro. The reason for this is that participants in the survey expressed a desire to be able to time the clock while listening to music. And this website in the mobile phone and computer two users to achieve self-adaptation. Unfortunately, despite several iterations of the app, there are still some minor issues that need to be addressed, and I'll be working on them in the future.
